This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors that can occur in HTML and JavaScript when dealing with the DOM. The first error involves attempting to access a non-existent attribute of an element.  The second error involves attempting to use a method (in this case, `addEventListener`) on a null objectâ€”an object that doesn't exist.  The provided solution emphasizes the importance of checking for null values before attempting to access properties or methods.  This prevents unexpected crashes or runtime errors, contributing to more robust and reliable web applications.
